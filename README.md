## Introduction

**[Infisical](https://infisical.com)** is the open source secret management platform that teams use to centralize their secrets like API keys, database credentials, and configurations.

The Infisical Go SDK provides a robust and efficient way for Go developers to integrate Infisical's secret management capabilities into their applications. With our SDK, you can seamlessly retrieve, update, delete, and manage your application's secrets. The SDK offers a simple API, making it easy to integrate Infisical's core features into your Go projects with minimal effort. Whether you are building microservices, cloud-native applications, or any other Go-based systems.

For detailed documentation on how to get started with the Infisical Go SDK, check out our [SDK Docs](https://infisical.com/docs/sdks/languages/go).
